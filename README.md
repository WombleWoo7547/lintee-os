# Lintee OS
Lintee OS is a arch-based OS for the Raspberry Pi. Installing is simple as I have a berryboot image available! If you don't know how to install berryboot then I have a guide in the berryboot.md file. Then, my berryboot image will be uploaded as soon as I find a way to upload more than a 3gb (EEK!) file onto GitHub.
